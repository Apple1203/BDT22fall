TLDR: This is a useless course (although it is a compulsory). The content is both trivial and useless.

The teacher often wastes a lot of time on very simple things, but rushes through the difficult parts very quickly. The teacher's catchphrase is "Oh, Sorry, I make a mistake," and she says it about 30 times per class, 
which drives me crazy. There is a lot of content covered in the exams, and it's impossible to finish the paper, so it's recommended to allocate time reasonably based on the marks. 

There is a group project, and the teacher only focus on whether you have clearly explained the problem and whether your summary is clear. 
Therefore, it is essential to find good teammates and not to team up with unreliable person, or your project will end up with the lowest grade. 

Overall, it is a very easy and useless course, but getting a high score is not difficult. You just need to perform well on presentations and reports (spend your time on visualization), and follow the tricks above on the final exam.

Score: 2.0/5

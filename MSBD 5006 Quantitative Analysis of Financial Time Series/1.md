The accent of the professor is horrible. You need at least 1 month to adapt to his accent. However, this is a very useful course and the prof provides very useful deduction of different models.
The overall workload is acceptable but is based on R. TA will provide the basic structure and the examples of all code and prof will tell us how to use the code and what is the result meaning. So it's not hard as 
long as you listen to prof carefully. The final is hard but the grading scheme is really good. It's easy to get A+, you just need to work on the questions in the example sheets.

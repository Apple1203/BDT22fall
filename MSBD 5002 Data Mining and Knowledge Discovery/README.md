- Course Description

    - Introduction: This section could provide an overview of the field of data mining and knowledge discovery, and why they are important. It could also provide an overview of the course goals, expectations, and requirements.

    - Getting to Know Your Data: This section could cover the process of collecting and preparing data for analysis, including data cleaning and preprocessing.

    - Data Preprocessing: This section could cover techniques for transforming raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis, such as normalization, scaling, and handling missing values.

    - Data Warehouse and OLAP Technology: An Introduction: This section could cover the basics of data warehousing and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), including data cube technology and multidimensional data analysis.

    - Advanced Data Cube Technology: This section could delve deeper into the technical aspects of data cube technology, including the use of OLAP tools and methods for data aggregation and analysis.

    - Mining Frequent Patterns & Association: Basic Concepts: This section could cover the basics of frequent pattern and association rule mining, including market basket analysis and the Apriori algorithm.

    - Mining Frequent Patterns & Association: Advanced Methods: This section could explore more advanced methods for frequent pattern and association rule mining, including sequential pattern mining and association rule mining with constraints.

    - Classification: Basic Concepts: This section could cover the basics of classification, including decision trees and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms.

    - Classification: Advanced Methods: This section could delve deeper into more advanced classification techniques, such as support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forests.

    - Cluster Analysis: Basic Concepts: This section could cover the basics of cluster analysis, including k-means and hierarchical clustering.

    - Cluster Analysis: Advanced Methods: This section could delve deeper into more advanced methods for cluster analysis, such as density-based clustering and graph-based clustering.

    - Outlier Analysis: This section could cover techniques for identifying and analyzing outliers in data, including methods for outlier detection and explanation.


- Overall Workload: Midterm + final exam + personal project (This year is about KDD 2022 challenge).

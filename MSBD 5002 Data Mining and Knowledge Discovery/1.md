This is really a useless course. The material provided and the expected learning outcome are vague. It's always hard to get what the professor is talking about. Besides, the project and the final exam are really independent of the course. In the course, we do not learn anything related to the project and the final, so why we are required to do this? And the time duration of the final exam is also meaningless. Can you sleep for 72 hours and work for 144 hours? Useless course.

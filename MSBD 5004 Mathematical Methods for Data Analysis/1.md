This course teaches everything related to maths, and I never learn deep learning from a mathematical view. So this course helps me a lot. The professor teaches things clearly and provide sufficient materials for us
to make a review. The assignments are not that easy, many of them needs hard work and team cooperation. Some are also on the website. If you can't solve it, try to search on Google. The final exam is not that difficult,
but you need to understand most questions in the assignment to get good grades. Since this is a compulsory so we'll get a curved grade. If you want to get A- you need at least 91 in total.

Score: 4.5/5

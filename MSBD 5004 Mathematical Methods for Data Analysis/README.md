- Course Description

Mathematics has played an essential role in data analysis; for example, Fourier analysis is one of the main tools for analyzing image and signal data. This course is to introduce some mathematical methods for data analysis. It will cover mathematical formulations and computational methods to exploit specific structures contained in the data.

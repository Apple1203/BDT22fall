# BDT22fall

A detailed description (Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional) of most of the courses offered by HKUST Big Data Technology can be found at my [website](https://apple1203.github.io/posts/10432.html).

This repository is about my Course Materials for HKUST BDT 22fall.

**NOTE:** All of the files in this repository is just for **STUDY AND COMMUNICATION**. Please **DON'T JUST COPY THIS ANSWER WITHOUT ANY CHANGES**, because all of the homework submitted will have a similarity score on canvas.

**注意：** 所有材料仅供学习与交流，不要直接抄答案，canvas有查重系统。

If you are **a UST student** and want the template I used in the homework (5012, etc.), please send me an email and I'll share the latex/powerpoint template to you.

- Course Description

This course covers core and recent machine learning algorithms. Topics include supervised learning algorithms (linear and logistic regression, generative models for classification, learning theory), deep learning algorithms (feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, transformers), unsupervised learning algorithms (variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, mixture models), reinforcement learning (classic RL, deep RL), and deployment issues (adversarial attack, explainable AI).

**Note: You can refer to [the course list of Nevin](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~lzhang/teach/courses.html) to see the latest syllabus. Due to our shortcut choice for the easiest HAs (HA 1 - 7), I find that this year (23spring comp5212 class) Nevin changes the choice of HAs (see the information below).**

COMP 5212 Machine Learning (2023 spring):

Three options are designed for the project component to cater for differences in background:

    Option 1: HA1/HA2, HA3/HA4, four of {HA5, HA6, HA7, HA8, HA9} (6x5=30%)  [HA1/HA2 means either HA1 or HA2, but not both]

    Option 2:  One of {HA5, HA6, HA7, HA8, HA9}, and a term project (5 + 25=30%)

    Option 3: Two of {HA5, HA6, HA7, HA8, HA9}, and a term project (2x5 + 25=35%)

The main advantage of Option 3 is the possibility of earning 5 more points than Options 1 and 2. Unlike Option 2, the term project scores of Option 3 will not be calibrated with H5-9 scores of Option 1.

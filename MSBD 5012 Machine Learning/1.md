This is a useful course and almost all of bdt students attend this course. The teaching is clear and the assignments are not difficult. Prof teaches things clearly and he also mentions some hot topic.
Topics including GAN, VAE, Transformers, and BERT, are all mentioned and is not hard to understand. Final is not hard, and as long as you understand the questions in written assignments, you can get at least A.

Score: 4.5/5

**Note: You can refer to [the course list of Nevin](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~lzhang/teach/courses.html) to see the latest syllabus. Due to our shortcut choice for the easiest HAs (HA 1 - 7), I find that this year (23spring comp5212 class) Nevin changes the choice of HAs (see the information below).**

COMP 5212 Machine Learning (2023 spring):

Three options are designed for the project component to cater for differences in background:

    Option 1: HA1/HA2, HA3/HA4, four of {HA5, HA6, HA7, HA8, HA9} (6x5=30%)  [HA1/HA2 means either HA1 or HA2, but not both]

    Option 2:  One of {HA5, HA6, HA7, HA8, HA9}, and a term project (5 + 25=30%)

    Option 3: Two of {HA5, HA6, HA7, HA8, HA9}, and a term project (2x5 + 25=35%)

The main advantage of Option 3 is the possibility of earning 5 more points than Options 1 and 2. Unlike Option 2, the term project scores of Option 3 will not be calibrated with H5-9 scores of Option 1.
